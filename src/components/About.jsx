          <h2>Who I Am</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a motivated Computer Engineering graduate from Trident Academy of Technology (Class of 2025), 
            with a deep passion for building modern web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expertise lies in Python full-stack development — from backend APIs with Django to dynamic frontends. 
            I love turning ideas into clean, working software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of code, I've been an active member of the College Cultural Committee, which sharpened my 
            communication and leadership skills.
